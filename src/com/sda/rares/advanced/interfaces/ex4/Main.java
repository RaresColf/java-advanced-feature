/**
 * ##### Interfaces class exercise 3
 *
 * Create a interface 'Graphic' that encapsulates the fallowing method:
 * - draw()
 *
 * Based on this interface implement two classes:
 * - Line: which should print at System out a line
 *
 *            ` "------------"`
 *
 * - Square: which should print at System out a square:
 *
 *        `    --------
 *            |      |
 *            |      |
 *            --------`
 *
 * - Text: which should print at System out a text
 *
 * Create a Main class where you should initialize an Array of type Graphic with different implementations (Line, Square, Text).
 * Next, with a for each call the draw() method on each of the array objects.
